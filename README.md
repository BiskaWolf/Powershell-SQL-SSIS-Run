# Powershell-SQL-SSIS-Run

Connect to a SQL Server, and run specified SSIS Package. With on-the-fly source data selection

After creating your SSIS package within Intergration Services, this Powershell will run that package on-demand and allow you
to select a source data file to import. 

I'm currently using this to import CSV files into an existing table.
